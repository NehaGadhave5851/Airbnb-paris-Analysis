# 🏠 Airbnb Paris Analysis

This project explores the evolution of the Airbnb market in Paris, focusing on how regulations, locality trends, and pricing dynamics have influenced both **host participation** and **customer demand**.

The analysis covers **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation** with clear visualizations and business recommendations.
